In the second sprint we managed to cover all the requirements
- set up the pipeline

- add the required links to "Get movie info"
- implemented a way of getting the "Movie info"
- created the required endpoints: creating a booking,
  getting a list of the free/booked seats,
  letting a user cancel/edit a booking, letting cinema users login with username and password and allow for opperations allowed for only authenticated users

On top of that, we also handled exceptions and implemented testing
